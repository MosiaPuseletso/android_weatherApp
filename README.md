# Simple Weather App in Android (Java)

This is a basic weather app developed for Android using Java. The app provides users with current weather information for a specified location using data from a weather API. It demonstrates how to make API calls, parse JSON data, and display the information in a user-friendly manner.

## Features

- **Current Weather Display**: The app displays the current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description for the chosen location.

- **Location Search**: Users can search for weather information by entering the name of a city or location.

- **API Integration**: The app integrates with a weather API to fetch real-time weather data for the selected location.
